This is a game where you guess the letters that make up the hidden word. The words are all related to the Legend of Zelda video game franchise - specifically Breath of the Wild.
This is useful because it's (maybe) fun.
To get started, just click anywhere on the screen once the page loads.
This is maintained by me, Jacob Hughes.
If you would like to help, the biggest changes would be to either clean up the script so that it's more concise, or add features such as:
*Showing the completed word before it's replaced
*Adding a congratulations screen after completing a word
